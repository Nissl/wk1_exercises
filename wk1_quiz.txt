1. What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
a = 1
  b = a
  b = 3

Answer: 1

2. What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?
  
Answer: Arrays organize information by reference to enumerated location. Hashes organize information
by reference to keys.

3. Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:
  arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
  [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
  [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!

Answer:
[1, 2, 3, 3]
[1, 2, 3] 
[1, 2, 3] 

4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

Answer: The .map method returns the result of running a block on each element in an array. The .select method
returns an array with the values that meet a condition specified in a block. You should use map when you
want to transform all elements in a block, and select when you want to pull out elements that meet specific criteria. 

5. Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

Answer:
# Strings 
h = { "one" => 1, "two" => 2 }
# symbols
h = { one: 1, two: 2 }

6. What is returned?
x = 1
  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

Answer:
"no way!"
# This is a ternary operator. If the criteria before the question mark is true, the first answer is returned; if false, the second answer is returned.

7. What is x?
x = 1
  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x
What is x?

Answer:
4
# You've incremented x four times.

8. 
3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x

 Answer:
 This causes an error, because you never defined x. You can't increment something that's undefined.
 If we assume x was defined earlier (for question 7), then the answer is 7, because you've incremented the previous value (4) 3 more times.
