Rails API is gone, but I took a TA's advice and installed Dash.
Incredibly handy because it's available offline and centralizes all of my documentation (for things beyond Ruby/Rails as well) in one place.

It's also very easy to search subsets of the documentation.

I'm still a bit too much of a novice to know what else I should be looking for.
